== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you make this when there are so many other tools out there? =

The Library Instruction Recorder is specifically designed to be simple, without a lot of the features often found in larger and more complex resource scheduling tools.  By reducing unnecessary features, librarians are able to easily record sessions and get statistical reports easily.

= What about resource scheduling? Or .ics files? Or attaching instructional materials? Or making me a cup of coffee? =

Right now there are no plans for major enhancements to LIR.
